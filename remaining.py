I'm drawing a blank
Living by the seat of your pants
Burning the candle from both ends
Take this with a grain of salt
Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
To paint a grim picture
I took the liberty of
To turn a blind eye
To paint the town red
Don't sell me a dog
A watched pot never boils
I'll reign it in
Out of the woods
Knock on wood
You can't have your cake and eat it too
Clutching at straws (or cats)
Kill two birds with one stone (or petting two cats with one hand)
Early bird catches the worm
Getting a run for your money
To see the light at the end of the tunnel
I'm on a kick
This grinds my gears
To bite of more than I can chew
Don't rest on your laurel
Treading water
The last straw
I've cooked my goose
Hand caught in the cookie jar
To spill the beans
It has a good ring to it
You can put your money on it
You can take it to the bank
To have an egg on one's face
Hitting the hay
It's all french to me
It's like herding cats
