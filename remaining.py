I'm drawing a blank
Living by the seat of your pants
Burning the candle from both ends
Take this with a grain of salt
Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
The tables have turned
Burn it into your memory
To paint a grim picture
I took the liberty of
You might turn a blind eye
That's the way the cookie crumbles
It rains cats and dogs
To paint the town red
Not my cup of tea
Don't sell me a dog
Sweating like a pig
A watched pot never boils
I'll reign it in
Just my two cents
Out of the woods
Knock on wood
You can't have your cake and eat it too
Clutching at straws
